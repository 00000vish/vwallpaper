Wrapper application that can control any utilitarian wallpaper apps (like feh, hyprpaper) and change wallpapers randomly from a directory. 

It works, but code might be ugly, just trying to learn rust.

# HOW TO USE
Copy the sample_config.toml into ~/.config/vwallpaper/config.toml

Update config.toml as needed

Run the vwallpaper
